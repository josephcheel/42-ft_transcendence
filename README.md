## Installation and Configuration
### 📦 Prerequisites for Installation

Before installing and running the project, make sure the following are available on your system:

- **Docker**  
- **Docker Compose**
- **Make** (for running setup commands)
- **.env** file with the required environment variables

### 1. Copy the `env_sample` as `.env` and change whatever you consider necessary

### 2. (OPTIONAL) Set a variable if you want to be available to your network. If not set, it defaults to `localhost`.
```bash
export IP_ADDR="{YOUR_IP}"
```


### 3. (OPTIONAL) You can also change the SSL_CERT_FILE and SSL_CERT_KEY in the .env to add your own certificate paths. If you don't specify them, a self-signed certificate (selfsigned.crt and selfsigned.key) will be generated by default.
```
SSL_CERT_FILE="{YOUR_FILE_CRT_PATH}"
SSL_CERT_KEY="{YOUR_FILE_KEY_PATH}"
```

### 4. Execute
```bash
make
```

## Usage
> [!NOTE]
> If you completed step 2 of the [Installation and Configuration](#installation-and-configuration), use the first option below.
if you set your own IP_ADDR environment variable then access via:
```
https://{YOUR_IP}:8000 
https://{YOUR_IP}:4000
```

if you have not set IP_ADDR then use:
```
https://localhost:8000 
https://localhost:4000
```
> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you did not set your own certificate, a self-signed one will be generated.
> This may trigger a warning that the connection is not secure — it's safe to proceed.
> Open both URLs and accept the certificate.
